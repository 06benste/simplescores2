## What’s on the site

- **Scores** – Today’s matches with live or final scores, kick-off times, and (when available) minutes played for games in progress.
- **Tables** – Current league standings: position, team, games played, goal difference, and points for Premier League, Championship, League One, and League Two.
- **Cups** – FA Cup and Carabao Cup scores (no league tables for these).
- **Scraper status** – When the data was last updated and when the next update is due.

## When it updates

- **Match days:** Scores and tables refresh **every 5 minutes** from shortly before the first kick-off until after the last match (plus a final update a bit later).
- **Daily:** A full refresh runs once per day in the early hours (UTC) so the schedule and pages are ready for the next day.

So on days with fixtures you get updates every 5 minutes during the match window; on other days the site may not change until the next daily run.
